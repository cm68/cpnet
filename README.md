this is a cp/net client and server for the Retrobrew Mark IV running cp/m 3.

the underlying software is the excellent RomWBW firmware, and the hardware
is a speedy Z180 with 512K ram, 512K rom, and it runs at 38 mhz.

the network hardware is an ESP-01 module grafted to the board in place of a
otherwise useless RS-425 serial port.

Status:  It's still a bit broken

this work is derived from:

https://github.com/durgadas311/cpnet-z80

and

https://github.com/hperaza/cpnet-server

it differs in that it is all buildable, and it's very compact
