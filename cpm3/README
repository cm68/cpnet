the cp/net client implementation assumes a tcp/ip stack connecting directly
with a cp/net server.

the only snios currently is for an ESP-01, running current AT command firmware
connected to ASCI1 on a retrobrew Mark IV on a boardlet.

to flash the ESP-01 with the current firmware:

esptool.py --chip esp8266 --port /dev/ttyUSB2 write_flash 0 ESP-01-1M.bin

the esp-01 module needs to be configured with network connection information
this is done with the espconf.com program.

espconf
since CP/M translates everything to upper case, espconf can't get
the arguments from the command line.  so, it prints out the current
config and prompts for the new values.

to load:
	A>NDOS

To stop/unload CP/NET:
	A>RSXRM NDOS

current issues:
not reliable
big
too many copies
